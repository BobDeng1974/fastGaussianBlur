# Fast Gaussian Blur
Gaussian blur is one of the basic building blocks of computer vision algorithms. This repo is a step-by-step tutorial that shows how it can be accelerated. The ideas used here can be used for other convolution operations.

To better understand the tips, follow the codes in this order:
1. memory_management
2. parallel_processing (to be comming soon)
3. simd (to be comming soon)
